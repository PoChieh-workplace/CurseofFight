# DISCLAIMER

This is an unsupported version of Incendium! Use at your own risk.

## What does this mean?

The datapack itself is fine, it's not experimental in any way. Instead, support will not be offered for small issues, incompatibilities, or other bugs.


If there is a game-breaking bug or crash, we will provide fixes for it.

## Why is it unsupported?

Stardust Labs is currently using all of its time it has for Incendium, and putting it into the rewrite.


When the rewrite is released, upgrading from this port to the rewrite may not be possible, or will involve resetting the nether dimension.
